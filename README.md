# Academic-Database-Design-Project-Medical-Center-Chain-DB
College semester project consisting of a complete database schema, metadata, dictionary and Entity-Relationship Diagram.

Primary purpose is to showcase that I have a deeper understanding of relational databases than just SQL and retrieving data.

Executive Summary

Dr. Robert Slate, owner and president of FirstCare Medical Centers, Inc in Alcoa, Florida requires an electronic, database driven system to take the place of the current manual paper system. The four FirstCare centers require center dependent tracking of patients, employees, nurses, pharmacists, contract physician scheduling, prescriptions, appointments and pharmaceutical inventory. The system must also be capable of reporting on physician assignments, daily appointments, revenue from medical care and pharmacy activity, vendor activity, daily dispensed drug log and a separate log of dispensed controlled substances. Appointments must be tracked, both by each physician’s weekly schedule at the various centers and by each center’s daily appointments.
Dr. Slate’s only constraint is that the system should be able to print a profile card and prescription label in the same format as is in use now. He is not currently interested in tracking payroll, accounts payable, and all other financial transactions or non-pharmacy supplies. Prescription logs for each patient will be generated on demand, as will reports on daily pharmacy sales, with a special requirement of reporting all controlled substances dispensed daily as a separate report from non-controlled drugs.
Above all, the design will contribute to the productivity of each location, and will improve the overall success of the chain.
